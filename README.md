# Face-segmentation
A face-segmentation notebook using U-Net architecture with Resnet34 encoder. 


I picked up some random images inside of the CelebA dataset and I trained a U-Net architecture with Resnet34 encoder to segment the face. The training did not take so long because I had small amount of images but the results were really satisfactory.
